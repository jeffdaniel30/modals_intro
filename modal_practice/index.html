				<h1>Learn to Play Bridge</h1>
				<p>
					Bridge is played with four people sitting at a card table using a
					standard deck of 52 cards (no jokers). The players across from each
					other form partnerships as North‑South and East‑West.
				</p>
				<p>
					Draw cards to select the person to deal the cards (the dealer). This
					person distributes the cards face down, in clockwise rotation one at a
					time, until each player at the table has a hand consisting of 13
					cards.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the play of each deal is completed, the opportunity to deal
					moves around the table clockwise so that each person has a turn to
					deal out the cards.
